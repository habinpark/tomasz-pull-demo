The capybara or greater capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a giant cavy rodent native to South America.
It is the largest living rodent and a member of the genus Hydrochoerus.
This sounds very scary!!
Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the nutria.
what other relatives do they have?
